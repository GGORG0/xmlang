# Introduction

**XMLang** is an esolang, that is also valid XML.
It is a fully-functional, turing-complete programming language, that features the basic things you would expect from a programming language, such as standard input/output, variables, functions, and control flow.

## Interpreter

The interpreter is written in Rust, allowing it to be relatively fast and very portable.
You can [run it locally on your machine](./interpreter/local.md), or [use the WebAssembly-powered online playground](./interpreter/playground.md) to try it out easily.
